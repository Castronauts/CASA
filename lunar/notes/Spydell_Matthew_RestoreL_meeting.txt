Alex Janas and Billy Gallagher

Agenda:
-Jack recommended contacing you for perspective on robotic arms and autonomous servicing/assembly
-Explain our goal with the arm and our research

-Where does teleoperation come in to play? Where does autonomy come in to play?
-Would you have like Restore-L to use completely autonomous technology or is direct human involvement still necessary?
Trade off time-savings (mission and latency) for accuracy.
Supervised autonomy - interplay of human interaction and autonomous systems. Verification of system operations by humans.
4-7 second time delay for LEO.
Powerful computing is difficult given the radiation.
High difficulty when aligning robotic arms using controls.
Identify various failure modes and how to recover.

-Given our type of experiment (simple telescope assembly) and your experience, what is possible with a COTS arm?


-Are there any constraints involving teleoperated and autonomous assembly that have not been investigated fully?
Video feed constraints - 8-12 cameras, only a couple operating at a time because of limited bandwidth.
Close up views and wide view for situational awareness, minimum two cameras for awareness and two for aligning arm

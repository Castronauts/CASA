Assembly experiment metrics for success
- Ask Terry
- Ask Nisar
- Trust (how much a human trusts a robot, how many times a human takes over)
- How far from making an optimal connection

Cameras
- Rolling shutter camera (not good for machine learning)
- Global shutter camera (good for machine learning) maybe $100
- OpenMV camera?

Lockheed
- DSG might be launched on EM-2 (no interaction between Orion and DSG on EM-2)
- EM-3 brings first habitat module; Orion will dock

Terry Fong
- Earth-to-Moon 10-15 second latency because of buffering and current Deep Space Network (DSN)
- In the immediate future real-time high-speed operations is not important. It's about science traversal missions (constantly stopping)
- What operation requires faster human interaction? That would require real-time operation
- High computing power spacecraft and rover in close proximity could drastically increase the amount of important science conducted; it's not about speeding operations up, it's about doing more because data doesn't need to be sent all the way back to Earth.

Nisar (CU Boulder)
- Human in the loop explortation
- Who to contact when a problem occurs

- Create a stronger interface between autonomous systems/programming and scientists
- Create on-the-fly reprogrammable autonomy for scientists
- Get scientists into the loop of autnonomous system design
